These widgets are pretty old and I quickly converted this library from PySide2
to PySide6.

Therefore, I hereby invoke international "Don't Judge Me" laws preventing any
and all real criticisms or liability of things not working (I think there is a
bug with the MainWindow class retaining geometry on close, but I've been too
busy [lazy] to fix it).

If you have any questions, feel free to leave your email as a comment on
GitHub.
